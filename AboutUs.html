                    <p>Hello everybody, I’m Tosin Ayileka and I’m a junior here at James Clemens. This coming year I will be assuming the role of Director of Records. I joined Triple I as a freshman and the club has had an immense influence on me as a leader and as a person. A little bit about myself, I am Section Leader in the Tuba Section for the Competition Marching Band and I have worked as a leader in multiple other capacities in the band and band-hosted programs such as Madison Music Camp. I am also an AP/Honor student and have received multiple awards to the effect as well. I am also a member of Greenpower, Technology Student Association, Black Student Union, and National Society of High School Scholars. I hope to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering or computer science.</p>
