                    <h4>Advisor</h4>
                    <p>I am a native of Decatur, Alabama. I am married to Keith Williams, with whom we have four awesome children, and several amazing grandchildren. I believe in the value of family and education. I have been teaching for over 24 years. I have taught at James Clemens since inception, and have taught General Biology and Pre-AP Biology. I am also the lead advisor of our Triple I Leadership Society club in which students take initiatives, become involved, and become productive influencers in the community. My hobbies include thinking, research in education, reading, cooking, gardening, and creating/designing for the marketplace. I also love to teach students the strategies of becoming innovative leaders.</p>
